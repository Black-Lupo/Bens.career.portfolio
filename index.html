        <h2>Meet Benjamin Jimenez Lopez: From Banking to Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>Since childhood, I’ve been fascinated by technology, spending hours tinkering with MS-DOS systems. That early passion continues to drive my learning and innovation today. With over 20 years in the financial industry, I’ve developed a diverse skill set, from providing exceptional service in retail banking to refining my work ethic and analytical abilities.</p>
    
        <p>I’m also passionate about Cybersecurity, holding an Undergraduate Certificate in Cybersecurity and a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology & Network. My expertise spans network administration, penetration testing, Python programming, and server management. I’m excited to merge my financial sector experience with my Cybersecurity knowledge to help organizations navigate today’s digital challenges. I look forward to joining a forward-thinking team that values both security and innovation.</p>
    
        <p>I began my career in banking, where I spent 20 years managing financial operations and ensuring compliance with strict data regulations. During that time, I developed a passion for technology and cybersecurity, recognizing the increasing threats posed to financial institutions. I have since pursued a degree in cybersecurity, expanded my expertise in network administration and penetration testing, and transitioned into IT consulting to help businesses stay secure in an evolving digital world.</p>
